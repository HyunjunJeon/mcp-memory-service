# MCP Memory Service Development Session Summary - August 3, 2025

## Session Overview
This development session focused on resolving critical GitHub issues and preparing a beta release for the MCP Memory Service project. The session involved fixing Docker CI/CD workflows, cleaning up obsolete branches, and releasing version 4.0.0-beta.1.

## Key Issues Resolved
- **GitHub Issue #71**: Docker CI/CD workflow failures due to missing 'load: true' parameter in build-push-action
- **GitHub Issue #72**: Test command failures in Docker workflow due to incorrect entrypoint handling

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Deprecated Node.js MCP Bridge
Made strategic decision to focus on native FastAPI MCP integration rather than maintaining the Node.js bridge. This simplifies the codebase and reduces maintenance overhead while providing better performance.

### 2. Beta Release Strategy  
Chose to release v4.0.0-beta.1 instead of a stable version to allow for community testing of the new dual-service architecture. This provides time to gather feedback before committing to API stability.

### 3. Codebase Simplification
Prioritized code grooming and removal of obsolete features over new feature development. This improves maintainability and reduces technical debt.

## Technical Changes Implemented

### Docker CI/CD Fixes
- **Fixed Docker build workflow** by adding `load: true` parameter to `docker/build-push-action@v5`
- **Updated Docker test commands** to use `--entrypoint=""` for proper command execution
- **Enhanced test reliability** with proper image loading and verification steps

### Version Management
- **Version bump** from 3.3.2 to 4.0.0-beta.1 using semantic-release automation
- **Automated changelog generation** with proper commit categorization
- **Multi-platform Docker publishing** to both Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry

### Branch Cleanup
- **Cleaned up 3 obsolete feature branches** that were no longer needed
- **Streamlined git workflow** with focus on main branch development
- **Improved repository organization** for better contributor experience

## Architecture Evolution

The project now features a **dual-service architecture**:

### HTTP API Service
- FastAPI-based web interface with dashboard
- RESTful endpoints for memory operations
- Real-time SSE connections for live updates
- Authentication support with API keys

### MCP Protocol Service  
- Native MCP-over-HTTP protocol support
- Full compatibility with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
- Async request/response handling
- Semantic memory operations (store, retrieve, search, delete)

### Unified Codebase
- Single repository managing both services
- Shared core logic and storage backends
- Common configuration and environment handling
- Consistent error handling and logging

## Release Context
