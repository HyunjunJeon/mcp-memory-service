# FastAPI MCP Server Migration Log

## Architecture Decision Record

**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Branch**: `feature/fastapi-mcp-native-v4`  
**Version**: 4.0.0-alpha.1

### Decision: Migrate from Node.js Bridge to Native FastAPI MCP Server

**Problem**: Node.js HTTP-to-MCP bridge has SSL handshake issues with self-signed certificates, preventing reliable remote memory service access.

**Solution**: Replace Node.js bridge with native FastAPI MCP server using official MCP Python SDK.

### Technical Findings

1. **Node.js SSL Issues**: 
   - Node.js HTTPS client fails SSL handshake with self-signed certificates
   - Issue persists despite custom HTTPS agents and disabled certificate validation
   - Workaround: Slash commands using curl work, but direct MCP tools fail

2. **FastAPI MCP Benefits**:
   - Native MCP protocol support via FastMCP framework
   - Python SSL stack handles self-signed certificates more reliably
   - Eliminates bridging complexity and failure points
   - Direct integration with existing storage backends

### Implementation Status

#### âœ… Completed (Commit: 5709be1)
- [x] Created feature branch `feature/fastapi-mcp-native-v4`
- [x] Updated GitHub issues #71 and #72 with migration plan
- [x] Implemented basic FastAPI MCP server structure
- [x] Added 5 core memory operations: store, retrieve, search_by_tag, delete, health
- [x] Version bump to 4.0.0-alpha.1
- [x] Added new script entry point: `mcp-memory-server`

#### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Complete all 22 core tools (excluding 8 dashboard tools)
- [ ] Advanced memory operations (recall, update_metadata, etc.)
- [ ] Time-based operations (recall_by_timeframe, delete_by_timeframe)
- [ ] Storage management tools (optimize_db, create_backup, etc.)
- [ ] Consolidation operations

#### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Expand Tool Implementation**: Add remaining 17 memory operations
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Claude Code
3. **Documentation**: Update README and setup guides
4. **Legacy Management**: Move Node.js bridge to `legacy/` directory
5. **Alpha Release**: Package and test alpha release

### Dashboard Tools Exclusion

**Decision**: Exclude 8 dashboard-specific tools from FastAPI MCP server.

**Rationale**: 
- HTTP dashboard at https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-dashboard provides superior web interface
- MCP server should focus on Claude Code integration, not duplicate dashboard functionality
- Clear separation of concerns: MCP for Claude Code, HTTP for administration

**Excluded Tools**:
- dashboard_check_health, dashboard_recall_memory, dashboard_retrieve_memory
- dashboard_search_by_tag, dashboard_get_stats, dashboard_optimize_db
- dashboard_create_backup, dashboard_delete_memory

### Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Node.js Bridge | FastAPI MCP |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Protocol | HTTPâ†’MCP translation | Native MCP |
| SSL Handling | Node.js HTTPS (problematic) | Python SSL (reliable) |
| Complexity | 3 layers (Claudeâ†’Bridgeâ†’HTTPâ†’Memory) | 2 layers (Claudeâ†’MCP Server) |
| Maintenance | Multiple codebases | Unified Python |
| Remote Access | SSL issues | Direct support |
| Mobile Support | Limited by bridge | Full MCP compatibility |

### Success Metrics

- [ ] All MCP tools function correctly with Claude Code
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS connectivity works without workarounds
- [ ] Performance equals or exceeds Node.js bridge
- [ ] Remote access works from multiple clients
- [ ] Easy deployment without local bridge requirements

This migration resolves the fundamental SSL connectivity issues while providing a more robust, maintainable architecture for the MCP Memory Service.
