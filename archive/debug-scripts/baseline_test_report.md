# MCP Memory Service - Baseline Test Report

**Date**: July 24, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Comprehensive Baseline Testing

## Test Summary

### ‚úÖ Successfully Tested Operations

1. **Core Memory Operations**
   - `check_database_health`: Working - Shows 318 memories in database
   - `dashboard_get_stats`: Working - Returns complete statistics
   - `debug_retrieve`: Working - Returns debug information
   - `debug_system_info`: Working - Complete system information

2. **Admin Operations**
   - `list_backups`: Working - Shows 4 existing backups
   - `optimize_db`: Working - Optimization threshold check functional

3. **Server Status**
   - Server starts successfully with CUDA acceleration
   - Deferred ChromaDB initialization working
   - Eager storage initialization successful
   - Platform detection: Windows x86_64, Python 3.11.9

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Operations with Issues

1. **Memory Storage/Retrieval**
   - `store_memory`: Creates ID but retrieval not working as expected
   - `retrieve_memory`: Not finding stored memories
   - `recall_memory`: Returns no memories
   - `search_by_tag`: Not finding tagged memories

2. **Backup Operations**
   - `create_backup`: Path conflict when backing up to same directory

3. **Export Operations**  
   - `export_memories`: Type error with include parameter

### üìä System Configuration

- **Database Location**: `C:\Users\heinrich.krupp\AppData\Local\mcp-memory`
- **Total Memories**: 318
- **Unique Tags**: 507
- **Database Size**: 71.86 MB
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CUDA enabled
- **Memory**: 63.56 GB available
- **Optimal Model**: all-mpnet-base-v2

### üîç Key Findings

1. The MCP memory service is functional but has some operational issues
2. The database contains 318 memories from previous sessions
3. New memory storage appears to work (generates IDs) but retrieval has issues
4. System configuration is optimized for CUDA acceleration
5. Path configurations need adjustment for backup operations

### üìù Recommendations Before Cleanup

1. **Backup Strategy**: Create backups in a different directory to avoid conflicts
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Investigate why new memories aren't being retrieved
3. **Export Function**: Fix the type error in export_memories function
4. **Testing**: Continue with cleanup but be prepared to restore if needed

## Installation Testing

### To Be Tested
- `python install.py` - Platform-aware installation
- `uv run memory` - UV tool execution
- Docker builds (all compose variants)
- MCP Inspector connectivity

## Next Steps

Given that the core functionality is working (database accessible, health checks pass), we can proceed with the cleanup operation while being careful to:
1. Preserve the existing 318 memories
2. Keep multiple backups before any destructive operations
3. Test after each major change

---

**Conclusion**: System is functional enough to proceed with cleanup, but some operational issues need to be addressed post-cleanup.
